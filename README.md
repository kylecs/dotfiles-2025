# 2025 dotfiles
Some fresh dotfiles I have been working on, this is a complete rewrite of configurations for all my CLI tools.

**Theme** - Catppuccin Mocha

**Font** - Geist Mono Nerd

## Terminal Emulator
**Ghostty** - nice terminal, minimal config required, catppuccin built in.

## Terminal Multiplexer
**tmux** - the tried and true, mainly visual tweaks / key rebinds. Includes vim-tmux-navigator.

## Shell
**Nushell** - still early days trying this but so far I like it a lot. Waiting to see if the lack of posix compliance becomes more trouble than it's worth. 

## Editor
**Neovim** - I'm quitting neovim distributions and building my own config from scratch. Still a work in progress.

## Other
**Zoxide** - this tool has probably saved my more time in total than any other
**Carapace** - Shell autocomplete with integration with a bunch of tools. Seems a bit fragile and not very configurable, but it's worked well enough so far.
